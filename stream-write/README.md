# stream-write

Back-end agnostic functionality to demo stream writes in `persistent`.

Specifically, the `library` component itself is back-end agonistic, but each `executable` chooses to demo streaming using single and batched inserts with a specific back-end.

## Benchmarks

### BatchingVsLoop

Comparing performance between performing multiple looped database calls and a batched one. Persistent does not support batched inserts yet, however there is a [PR](https://github.com/yesodweb/persistent/pull/770) to do so. This sample project was put together to demo performance gains of batching. Note: Benchmarks done using a local database.

Conclusion
- Batching wins without any network latencies.
- Network latencies will only make batching even more appealing, i.e. fewer net round-trips to the database.
